docker run centos
It will pull image of centos from dokcer hub registry then run centos’s container.

docker pull nginx
It will pull/download image of nginx only not run container.

To run command in interactive mode means log in into docker container & run command,
docker run -it centos bash – bash is a command to enter in bash shell
12e3435@docker#: hostname
12e3435

Now, check container of centos is runnig or not ?
docker ps 
centos container ID

Not runnig.

Why container of centos is not runnig ?
Bcz, there is no any process which are runnig in this container of centos
if no any process are not runnig then container will stop & exited itself

If any of process are running then container will runnig till procees does not end.

So,
docker run centos sleep 20
docker ps
centos container ID


The process ais runnnig in cotainer, centos’s
docker rm centos
Error: unable to delete container centos , bcz, it has process is running.

docker rm “container_id” to remove container
docker rmi “image_id” of that container

docker images list
nginx
jenkins
# centos not found.




Run container with command
docker run ubuntu sleep 100
# Here, you can not write command or not be able to perform any command/tasks till your process sleep 100 doesn’t completed/stopped.

After complete this process you can perform commands etc.

Run container with command in a background
docker run -d ubuntu sleep 100
-d – to performe any tasks in background even your container is running state.

docker run -d ubuntu sleep 100
docker@root#: ls -ltr
docker@root#: docker ps

To run a command in a running container /inside containerid@name
docker exec “container_id” “your_command”

docker exec 1234 cat  /etc/*release.
